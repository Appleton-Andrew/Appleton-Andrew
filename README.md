### Hi there 👋

## An interesting dataset

I like this dump of Discogs.com metadata:
https://archive.org/details/discogs-dumps

Using data mined from Discogs.com, connections can be drawn between regional music scenes and their sometimes brief and ephemeral artifacts. 
Unfortunately, the metadata in this dataset is not organized or structured very well, which limits interoperability.
There are no barriers to accessing the data, and in fact Discogs.com has an open API so that users can pull data directly from their site. This would give researchers the opportunity to structure the data in more useful ways.
